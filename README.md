Passworts
============

Passworts is a password generator written in Python. It is using the marokov model to create passwords out of big dictionaries. You are able to set up length and count of passwords and the program will create passwords.
In May 2015 we started bringing the python script to the web. Therefore we use Flask, a Python web framework.
